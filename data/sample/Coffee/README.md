# Coffee

Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. The coffee dataset is a two-class problem to distinguish between Robusta and Aribica coffee beans. Further information can be found in the original paper (see [1]). The data were first used in the time series classification literature by Bagnall et al. (see [2]).
