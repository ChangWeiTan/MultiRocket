# Beef

Food spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. The beef data set consists of four classes of beef spectrograms, from pure beef and beef adulterated with varying degrees of offal. Further information can be found in the original paper by Jowder et al. [1]. The data were first used in the time series classification literature by Bagnall et al. [2].
