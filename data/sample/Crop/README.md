The new generation Earth Observation (EO) satellites have been imaging the Earth frequently, completely and at high resolution. This introduces unprecedented opportunities to monitor the dynamics of any regions on our planet over time and revealing the constant flux that underpins the bigger picture of our World. 

This data set is a subset of a bigger data set [1], which originally comes from 46 geometrically and radiometrically corrected images taken by FORMOSAT-2 satellite. These images are corrected such that every pixel corresponds to the same geographic area on Earth. Each pixel represents an area of 64 square meter; with 1 million pixels per image, this results in an area of 64 square kilometer per image. Each geographic area (a pixel) forms a time series of length of 46, showing the temporal evolution of that area.

There are 24 classes corresponding to what the land covers.
